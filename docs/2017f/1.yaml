abstract: Clebsch-Gordan coefficients play a central role in classical particle physics, representation theory, and special functions.  Based on Wigner's formula (1931), we give a new combinatorial procedure for computing these coefficients using Pascal's triangle.  These methods lead to a strong proof of a conjecture by Brudno and Rau on a certain vanishing condition.  In turn, nearby families of zeros are revealed and considered.  The overall program is joint work with Won Geun Kim and M. S. Ravi.
